# GCP Learning Repository

Welcome to my **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Learning** repository.  
This is my personal space to document everything I learn while exploring GCP.

---

## 📚 What You’ll Find Here
- **Step-by-Step Notes with Screenshots**  
  Each GCP service I learn will have its own folder containing a detailed guide with commands, explanations, and screenshots.
- **Terraform Code for Each Service**  
  Infrastructure-as-Code examples to automate GCP resource creation.  
  Each service folder includes a `terraform/` directory with reusable Terraform modules.

## 🚀 Goal
Create a **single reference hub** for:
- Quick revision of GCP concepts  
- Ready-to-use Terraform templates  
- Sharing knowledge with others learning GCP

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- **GCP account** with appropriate permissions  
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed  
- Basic command-line knowledge

---

## 💡 How to Use
1. Navigate to the service folder you’re interested in.  
2. Read the `README.md` inside for step-by-step instructions and screenshots.  
3. Use the Terraform code in the `terraform/` subfolder to provision resources.

---

## 🗒️ Notes
- All screenshots are for learning purposes only.  
- Terraform code is tested in personal projects; adjust variables for production use.
